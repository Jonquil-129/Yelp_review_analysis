Code:  (1) filter.R is used for intuitively at first taking a look at how many steakhouses are there. (You can ignore it)
       (2) part1_dataprocessing* is ipynb code, using data file review.JSON and business.JSON. Just save these two files and part1_* in same directory and data pre-processing can be done by just following this part. 
       (3) 2.Model_buiding* and part3_organized* are following part1*, you can folow these two codes to get the result of topic selection.
       (4) bus_regression* is for linear model building after (1) (2) (3), the middle file you may need is in directory output_csv.
